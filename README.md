# SAS-Project
A statistical project using SAS to estimate and compare multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression models 

Choose 3 lists of 36 stocks on the TSX from
http://clouddc.chass.utoronto.ca.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/ds/cfmrc/
Pick 36 stocks based on My name- YA JUN BAI
• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with Y or A (call this the 1st group from 2013)
• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with J or U (call this the 2nd group from 2014)
• 36 stocks whose symbols begin with B or A (call this the 3rd group from 2015)
and get an end of day price for ALL of them on the same date (April 9).


We are using SAS to estimate a multiple regression model, 𝑦 = 𝑓(𝑥1, 𝑥2),
Y= B0+B1X1+B2X2
y- Stock price of 2015
x1- Stock price of 2013
x2- Stock price of 2014
and justify the scientific significance of the variable(s) and the estimated model with t test, F test,
R-squared, adjusted R squared. For each test, we identify the null and alternative hypotheses, the
statistic value, and the p-value and conclusion.
